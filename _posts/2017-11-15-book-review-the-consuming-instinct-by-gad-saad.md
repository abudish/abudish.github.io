## A view on consumer behavior through the lense of evolutionary psychology

This review won't be completely objective since I'm planning to think out loud about implications of the knowledge gained from this book.
I'll try to provide citations and thoughts on how can a layman apply the information from the book.
The review will be written from consumer's point of view, not marketer's.
Speaking metaphorically I'll try teach how to use a shield not a sworld.
